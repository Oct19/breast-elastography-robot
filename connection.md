## Pins and Wiring

Beside the usual `VCC` and`GND` pins, the following pins are used:

- STM USB PORT - COMPUTER USB PORT

- STM PB10 (`I2C2_SCL`) - OLED SCL
- STM PB11 (`I2C2 SDA`) - OLED SDA
- STM PB3  (`Z_RESET`) - LIMIT SWITCH Z NO
- STM PB4  (`A_RESET`) - LIMIT SWITCH A NO
- STM PB12 (`ENA`) - STEP DRIVER ENA-
- STM PB13 (`DIR0`) - STEP DRIVER 0 DIR-
- STM PB14 (`PUL0`) - STEP DRIVER 0 PUL-

- STEP DRIVER ENA+ - 5V
- STEP DRIVER DIR+ - 5V
- STEP DRIVER PUL+ - 5V
- STEP DRIVER A+ - MOTOR RED
- STEP DRIVER A- - MOTOR BLUE
- STEP DRIVER B+ - MOTOR BLACK
